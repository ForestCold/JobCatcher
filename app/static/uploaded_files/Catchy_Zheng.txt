baseline price from consumers’ point of view
· Developed robust baseline sales estimation using linear regression and Random Forest to analyze sales in the absence of price
promotion

SELECTED PROJECTS

Rating Based Multi-level Tag Recommendation
Apr - Jun 2018
· Recommended diﬀerent tags to diﬀerent ratings of a movie based on the emotional value provided by SentiWordNet as well
as user preference and movie similarity
· Filtered meaningless tag with Hadoop based on part of speech, classiﬁed the rest into proper, genre, sentiment, and stored
in MySQL
· Built the hierarchical structure of user model and movie model with Python

Weibo Social Network Analysis
Apr - Jun 2017
· Used TF-IDF and TextRank to ﬁnd the most popular 20 keywords on Weibo Dataset and applied PageRank as well as degree
rank to ﬁnd the most inﬂuential 10 Big Data related users
· Applied Fast Unfolding algorithm to detect community in user social graph and analyzed the inﬂuence of keyword cluster

Classiﬁcation and Regression Data Contest
Nov 2016 - Jan 2017
· Applied Relief-F, cross entropy and mutual information to do feature selection and adjust attributes’ weight
· Applied Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, kNN, Ensemble Learning etc., to do classiﬁcation
or regression with Python and the accuracy on four datasets ranked top 5 in class

Nationwide Water Capacity Fuzzy Prediction Model
Jan - Feb 2016
· Assessed the water resource capacity of each province based on dynamic fuzzy matrix and constructed a grading system with
agricultural, industrial, residential factors for each province nationwide
· Predicted water resource per capita using regression forecasting model built by Matlab according to features of climate
change and population trends

Construction of a Company Bill Management System
Nov 2016 - Dec 2016
· Used MySQL to establish the database, designed the web page layout, and realized the function of registering, logging in,
adding, modifying, and deleting bill
· Designed two modes of user and administrator allowing them to do queries and calculations in individual and whole ﬁeld
