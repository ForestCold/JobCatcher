  May. 2018 – Aug. 2018   

  Built  an  Android  client  for  the  new  payment  SDK  from  the  scratch  with  careful  considerations  for  all  possible 

exceptions, with user-friendly UIs, and with fancy animations. Brought credit card scanning feature into the SDK by 

integrating the Card-IO open source library. 

  Extracted the general requirements and logics from existing SDKs, implemented and refined a new network library 

based on OkHttp (a popular open source library) for future SDKs’ convenience. Brought SSL certificate pinning 

feature into the network library, and made it configurable for different scenarios. 

  Achieved 100% code coverage (unit test) for the SDK by using Robolectric, Mockito and relative frameworks.
